# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing a comprehensive emotion detection system that can classify emotions from three different modalities: images, text, and video (camera feed). The system will use publicly available datasets to train separate models for each modality, as well as a combined multi-modal model that can process all three input types. The emotions to be classified are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, and sadness. The implementation will be provided as Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation and training.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to train an image-based emotion detection model, so that I can classify emotions from facial expressions in static images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes an image input THEN it SHALL classify the emotion into one of six categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness
2. WHEN training the image model THEN the system SHALL use a publicly available facial emotion dataset (such as FER-2013 or AffectNet)
3. WHEN implementing the image model THEN the system SHALL use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture optimized for facial emotion recognition
4. WHEN the model is trained THEN it SHALL achieve reasonable accuracy on validation data and provide performance metrics
5. WHEN the training is complete THEN the system SHALL save the trained model for inference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to train a text-based emotion detection model, so that I can classify emotions from written text content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes text input THEN it SHALL classify the emotion into one of six categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness
2. WHEN training the text model THEN the system SHALL use a publicly available text emotion dataset (such as Emotion Dataset for NLP or GoEmotions)
3. WHEN implementing the text model THEN the system SHALL use transformer-based architecture (such as BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT) for natural language processing
4. WHEN preprocessing text data THEN the system SHALL handle tokenization, encoding, and appropriate text cleaning
5. WHEN the model is trained THEN it SHALL achieve reasonable accuracy on validation data and provide performance metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to train a video-based emotion detection model, so that I can classify emotions from real-time camera feed or video sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes video input THEN it SHALL classify emotions from sequential frames into one of six categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness
2. WHEN training the video model THEN the system SHALL use a publicly available video emotion dataset (such as RAVDESS or EmotiW)
3. WHEN implementing the video model THEN the system SHALL use a combination of CNN for spatial features and RNN/LSTM for temporal sequence modeling
4. WHEN processing video data THEN the system SHALL handle frame extraction, face detection, and temporal sequence preparation
5. WHEN the model processes real-time camera feed THEN it SHALL provide emotion predictions with reasonable latency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to train a multi-modal emotion detection model, so that I can combine information from image, text, and video inputs for more accurate emotion classification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives multi-modal input (combination of image, text, and/or video) THEN it SHALL provide a unified emotion classification
2. WHEN implementing the multi-modal model THEN the system SHALL use fusion techniques to combine features from different modalities
3. WHEN training the multi-modal model THEN the system SHALL leverage the pre-trained individual models as feature extractors
4. WHEN combining modalities THEN the system SHALL handle cases where not all modalities are available (graceful degradation)
5. WHEN the multi-modal model makes predictions THEN it SHALL provide confidence scores for each emotion class

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want comprehensive Jupyter notebooks for each model, so that I can understand, reproduce, and modify the training process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the notebooks THEN each modality SHALL have a separate, well-documented Jupyter notebook
2. WHEN running the notebooks THEN they SHALL include data loading, preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and evaluation sections
3. WHEN reviewing the code THEN each notebook SHALL contain detailed explanations of the ML methods and architectural choices
4. WHEN executing the notebooks THEN they SHALL include visualization of training progress, confusion matrices, and sample predictions
5. WHEN using the notebooks THEN they SHALL be executable end-to-end with clear installation and setup instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dataset handling and preprocessing pipelines, so that I can efficiently work with publicly available emotion datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading datasets THEN the system SHALL automatically download and prepare publicly available datasets
2. WHEN preprocessing data THEN the system SHALL handle data augmentation techniques appropriate for each modality
3. WHEN splitting data THEN the system SHALL create proper train/validation/test splits with stratification
4. WHEN handling datasets THEN the system SHALL provide data exploration and visualization capabilities
5. WHEN working with different datasets THEN the system SHALL normalize labels to the six target emotion categories
